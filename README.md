# VORTEX

VORTEX is a local terminal coding agent built around an OpenAI-compatible chat API, a Rich-based TUI, and a small tool system for reading files, editing code, running shell commands, and managing sessions.

It is designed to run against a working directory on your machine, stream model output live, show tool calls as they happen, and keep enough session state around to support multi-step coding tasks.

## What This Project Does

- Runs in interactive mode or single-prompt mode
- Streams VORTEX agent output and tool execution in a custom terminal UI
- Lets the model call local tools such as file read/write/edit, search, shell, and memory
- Builds a compact workspace snapshot so the agent starts with project context
- Builds a lightweight symbol index so the agent can reason about functions, classes, structs, and types
- Supports approval policies for risky or mutating actions
- Saves sessions and checkpoints
- Loads extra tools from `.ai-agent/tools`
- Can connect to MCP servers and register their tools
- Supports custom model/provider profiles with different API keys and base URLs

## How It Runs

The packaged CLI command is `vortex`. For development, the entrypoint remains [main.py](./main.py).

By default:

- the app starts in interactive mode if you run `vortex`
- if you do not pass `--cwd`, VORTEX shows a workspace picker before the session starts
- the picker includes a `Custom path...` option for manually entering a project directory
- the selected working directory is remembered for later sessions
- the terminal UI is rendered by [ui/tui.py](./ui/tui.py)
- the agent runtime is driven by [agent/agent.py](./agent/agent.py)

Single prompt mode:

```bash
vortex "write a hello world program in c"
```

Interactive mode:

```bash
vortex
```

Use a different working directory:

```bash
vortex --cwd .
```

Switch projects inside the app:

```text
/cwd
/cwd .
/cwd ~/some/project
/cwd 2
```

## Working Directory Behavior

Config and tool discovery are tied to the active `cwd`.

- If you run `vortex --cwd <path>`, that directory is used directly
- If you run `vortex` interactively, VORTEX asks you to choose a working directory first
- Custom paths are validated as existing directories before the session switches to them
- Recent working directories are remembered and can be reopened with `/cwd <index>` or viewed with `/recent`
- If you want project-local config from the repo root, run `vortex --cwd .`
- `.ai-agent/config.toml` is loaded from the active working directory
- `AGENT.MD` is also loaded from the active working directory
- `.ai-agent/tools/*.py` is discovered from the active working directory

Changing `cwd` is treated as a project switch:

- the app reloads config and `AGENT.MD` from the new directory
- project-local tools are rediscovered
- the workspace snapshot and code index are rebuilt
- the live session context is reset to avoid mixing projects

## Requirements

VORTEX now ships as a Python package, so you do not need to install each dependency by hand.

The published PyPI distribution name is `vortex-agent-cli`. The installed command stays `vortex`.

Recommended install for a CLI app:

```bash
pipx install vortex-agent-cli
```

Local repo install:

```bash
python3 -m pip install . --no-build-isolation
```

One-command install from a downloaded zip or checkout:

```bash
./scripts/install.sh
```

That script creates `.venv`, installs the package, and gives you a `vortex` executable at `.venv/bin/vortex`.

If you are working from a checkout before the first public release, use `pipx install . --pip-args="--no-build-isolation"` or `./scripts/install.sh`.

Core Python dependencies used by the codebase include:

- `openai`
- `rich`
- `click`
- `python-dotenv`
- `pydantic`
- `platformdirs`
- `prompt_toolkit`
- `tomli` for Python versions without `tomllib`

Optional integrations:

- `ddgs` for web search
- `fastmcp` for MCP usage

The bundled `requirements.txt` remains available for compatibility, but `pyproject.toml` is now the primary install source for the app and Docker image.

## Publishing To PyPI

The repo now includes:

- CI packaging validation in [`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](./.github/workflows/ci.yml)
- a release workflow in [`.github/workflows/publish-pypi.yml`](./.github/workflows/publish-pypi.yml)
- PyPI-ready metadata in [`pyproject.toml`](./pyproject.toml)

First-time setup:

1. Create the `vortex-agent-cli` project on PyPI.
2. In PyPI, add a Trusted Publisher for GitHub Actions with owner `jagdep-singh`, repository `VORTEX`, workflow `publish-pypi.yml`, and environment `pypi`.
3. In GitHub, create an environment named `pypi`. Add required reviewers if you want a manual approval gate before publish.

Release flow:

1. Bump the version in [`pyproject.toml`](./pyproject.toml).
2. Commit the version change and push it.
3. Create a GitHub Release for that version tag.
4. The `publish-pypi` workflow builds the package, runs tests, checks the distributions, and publishes to PyPI.
5. After the release is live, users can install it with `pipx install vortex-agent-cli`.

## Environment Variables

Legacy single-provider setup:

```bash
API_KEY=your_key_here
BASE_URL=https://api.openai.com/v1
```

You can place these in a local `.env` file. If you store secrets in `.env`, keep that file out of version control.

## Docker

This repo now includes:

- [Dockerfile](./Dockerfile)
- [.dockerignore](./.dockerignore)
- [docker/entrypoint.sh](./docker/entrypoint.sh)
- [pyproject.toml](./pyproject.toml)

The container is built for interactive terminal usage.

Build the image:

```bash
docker build -t vortex .
```

Compose build:

```bash
docker compose build
```

Start with Compose:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

For this specific project, `docker compose run --rm vortex` is usually the better choice because VORTEX is an interactive terminal app rather than a background service.

Interactive Compose run:

```bash
docker compose run --rm vortex
```

Run it against the current directory as the working project:

```bash
docker run --rm -it \
  --env-file .env \
  -v "$PWD":/workspace \
  -v vortex-data:/data \
  vortex
```

What that does:

- mounts your current directory into `/workspace`
- stores app data, sessions, and platformdirs state in `/data`
- starts the agent with `/workspace` as the default `--cwd`
- keeps the TUI interactive because of `-it`

Single prompt mode:

```bash
docker run --rm -it \
  --env-file .env \
  -v "$PWD":/workspace \
  -v vortex-data:/data \
  vortex "write a hello world program in c"
```

Use a different mounted project:

```bash
docker run --rm -it \
  --env-file .env \
  -v /path/to/project:/workspace \
  -v vortex-data:/data \
  vortex
```

Override the working directory manually:

```bash
docker run --rm -it \
  --env-file .env \
  -v "$PWD":/workspace \
  -v vortex-data:/data \
  vortex --cwd /workspace/subdir
```

Notes:

- the container defaults to `/workspace` unless you pass your own `--cwd`
- if you want custom `.ai-agent/config.toml`, put it inside the mounted project
- if you want to avoid root-owned files on Linux, add `--user "$(id -u):$(id -g)"`
- the base image includes the app and core Python dependencies, but not optional `ddgs` or `fastmcp`

## Custom Model Profiles

VORTEX now supports named provider profiles, so users are not locked to one model or one API key.

You can define them in `.ai-agent/config.toml` for the active working directory:

```toml
active_model_profile = "openai"

[models.openai]
base_url = "https://api.openai.com/v1"
api_key_env = "OPENAI_API_KEY"

[models.openai.model]
name = "gpt-5-mini"
temperature = 0.2
max_output_tokens = 8192

[models.openrouter]
base_url = "https://openrouter.ai/api/v1"
api_key_env = "OPENROUTER_API_KEY"

[models.openrouter.model]
name = "nvidia/nemotron-3-super-120b-a12b:free"
temperature = 0
max_output_tokens = 8192
```

VORTEX now discovers models directly from each configured provider using that profile's resolved API key and base URL. `/models` only shows the models that provider reports for the key it is actually using.

You can also inline a key directly:

```toml
[models.local_gateway]
base_url = "https://example.com/v1"
api_key = "your_key_here"

[models.local_gateway.model]
name = "some/model"
temperature = 0
max_output_tokens = 8192
```

Runtime commands:

- `/models` shows configured profiles and the models discovered for each profile
- `/models refresh` refetches the model list from each configured provider and sends a tiny probe request to update each model's status
- `/model openrouter` switches to a named profile
- `/model use openrouter` also switches to a named profile
- `/model 1` switches to the first discovered model
- typing `1` at the prompt also selects the first discovered model after `/models`
- `/model openai/gpt-5.4-mini` changes the current model name directly
- `/model force 17` is available for compatibility, but model discovery no longer depends on a health guard
- `/model openrouter/free` changes the current model name directly
- `/config` shows the active model, base URL, and API key source

If the active profile has no resolved API key, the app will warn you.

## Interactive Commands

The terminal command set currently includes:

- `/help`
- `/exit`
- `/quit`
- `/clear`
- `/scan`
- `/index`
- `/cwd [path|index]`
- `/recent`
- `/config`
- `/models [refresh]`
- `/model <name|number>`
- `/model force <name|number>`
- `/approval <mode>`
- `/stats`
- `/tools`
- `/mcp`
- `/save`
- `/checkpoint [name]`
- `/sessions`
- `/resume <session_id>`
- `/restore <checkpoint_id>`

Useful interaction behavior:

- `Ctrl+C` stops the current run without exiting the app
- arrow keys and in-memory history work when `prompt_toolkit` is active
- VORTEX falls back to a plain terminal prompt on Python 3.14+ or terminals where `prompt_toolkit` is unreliable
- VORTEX agent output streams live
- tool calls are rendered as structured terminal cards
- the agent refreshes a compact workspace snapshot at the start of each run
- the agent also refreshes a lightweight codebase index and exposes it through `/index` and `find_symbol`
- `/cwd` switches the whole active project and rebuilds session context

## Codebase Index

VORTEX now includes a lightweight source-code index that extracts symbols from common languages such as Python, C, C++, JavaScript, TypeScript, Go, Rust, and Java.

This gives the agent a faster way to orient itself around a project:

- a compact symbol summary is injected into the system prompt
- `/scan` refreshes and shows the current workspace snapshot
- `/index` shows the current symbol index in the TUI
- the built-in `find_symbol` tool can look up functions, classes, structs, enums, interfaces, types, traits, and macros by name

This is intentionally heuristic and lightweight. It is not a full language server, but it gives the agent a much better structural map of the workspace than plain file listing alone.

## Approval Modes

Approval policy values come from [config/config.py](./config/config.py):

- `on-request`
- `on-failure`
- `auto`
- `auto-edit`
- `never`
- `yolo`

These control when the agent pauses before mutating files or executing risky actions.

## Built-in Tools

The built-in tool registry is created in [tools/registry.py](./tools/registry.py).

Current built-ins:

- `read_file`
- `write_file`
- `edit`
- `find_symbol`
- `shell`
- `list_dir`
- `grep`
- `glob`
- `web_search`
- `web_fetch`
- `todos`
- `memory`

The project also registers two built-in subagent tools from [tools/subagents.py](./tools/subagents.py):

- `subagent_codebase_investigator`
- `subagent_code_reviewer`

## Tool Discovery

Custom tools can be dropped into:

- `<cwd>/.ai-agent/tools/*.py`
- the user config directory returned by `platformdirs.user_config_dir("ai-agent")`

Each discovered file is imported dynamically and any `Tool` subclasses are registered.

## MCP Support

MCP servers are configured in `.ai-agent/config.toml` and initialized through:

- [tools/mcp/mcp_manager.py](./tools/mcp/mcp_manager.py)
- [tools/mcp/client.py](./tools/mcp/client.py)
- [tools/mcp/mcp_tool.py](./tools/mcp/mcp_tool.py)

Both stdio-style servers and HTTP/SSE-style servers are supported by config.

## Sessions, Checkpoints, and Memory

Session persistence lives in [agent/persistence.py](./agent/persistence.py).

The app can:

- save a session
- list sessions
- resume a session
- create a checkpoint
- restore a checkpoint

User memory is loaded from the app data directory and injected into context when available.

## Hooks

Hooks are configured in `.ai-agent/config.toml` and executed by [hooks/hook_system.py](./hooks/hook_system.py).

Available trigger points:

- `before_agent`
- `after_agent`
- `before_tool`
- `after_tool`
- `on_error`

## Terminal UI

The current UI is a custom Rich interface with:

- a cyan-on-dark shell theme
- a VORTEX ASCII header
- streaming VORTEX agent output
- inline styling for backticked text
- structured tool call panels
- approval prompts
- status lines for model thinking/progress

The input prompt prefers `prompt_toolkit` when the terminal and Python version cooperate, and falls back to a plain built-in terminal prompt otherwise so input still works reliably.

## Project Layout

High-level structure:

```text
main.py                  CLI entrypoint
agent/                   agent loop, events, session, persistence
client/                  OpenAI-compatible streaming client and response models

workspace/               default working directory
```

## Current State

This project is already usable for local coding tasks, and it now installs like a normal Python CLI, but there is still room to improve the end-user experience further.

A few practical things to know:

- the PyPI release path is automated, but the first Trusted Publisher setup still needs to be done once
- secrets/config handling is flexible but not yet polished into a full settings flow
- optional integrations are lazy-loaded and only matter if you use those features
- the default experience is centered around the local `workspace/` folder

## Quick Start

1. Install VORTEX with `pipx install vortex-agent-cli`, `pipx install . --pip-args="--no-build-isolation"`, or `./scripts/install.sh`.
2. Set `API_KEY` and optionally `BASE_URL`, or configure a model profile.
3. Run `vortex`.
4. Type a request at the `╰─ you ›` prompt.
5. Use `/help` if you want to inspect commands from inside the app.
